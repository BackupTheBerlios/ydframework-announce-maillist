Subject: [ydf-announce] Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 final released
Message-ID: <4aef63030602120714m4ee3d49fpfd89942bdc6739f@mail.gmail.com>

YELLOW DUCK FRAMEWORK 2.0 FINAL RELEASED

After a long time since the last release candidate, the Yellow Duck
Framework team is happy to announce the availability of version 2.0 final.
We've been through a long time adding new features and fixing loads of small
bugs.

The files are unfortunately not released on berlios.de but can be downloaded
from:
http://ydframework.berlios.de/download/

The files will also appear in the list of releases on berlios.de as soon as
the system allows me to ;-)

Regards;


pieter
